# GPU Accelerated Real Time Raytracer

Features implemented:

+ Unity-style camera movement
+ Raytracing with control over levels of recursion from GUI
+ Intersections with spheres, planes and triangles as primitives
+ Simple point lighting
+ AABB intersection checks for acceleration

## Features to implement

- [ ] Loading of 3D meshes into scene (FBX binary and OBJ ascii parser)
- [ ] HLBVH acceleration structure
- [ ] Movement of primitives
- [ ] Environment cubemap
- [ ] Area lights
- [ ] Distribution raytracing (Depth of field, anti-aliasing)

## Future upgrades

- [ ] Path tracing
- [ ] Support for BRDFs and BTDFs
